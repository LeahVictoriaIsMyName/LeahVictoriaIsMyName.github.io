        <p>Description</p>
        <p>You know when nature was king on phones and they randomly made everything flat? Well, i had no tolerance to that, so i always used the GS3, untill it broke, but now, i can make my own theme for OneUI, made by hackers, designed for users. (OneUI Core based, might work on OneUI)</p>
